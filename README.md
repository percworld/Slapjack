# Slapjack
Card Game - final assessment and solo project at Turing/1-module

Slapjack - a traditional game that given the current climate we may be safer playing with a machine.
This version of slapjack is utilizing basic javaScript functionality, CSS stylings and HTML script to simulate an old favorite.

### Slapjack is meant for two players on either one keyboard or a utilizing separate paired keyboards.

### Keyboard operators are keys 'q' and 'f' for player 1, 'p' and 'j' for player 2.
### Each player is dealt half of a deck of shuffled cards and their card count is located under their color coded deck.

## Rules of the game may vary from house to house so here is a guide to get you started:

Rules:
1. Players take turns dealing a card. Player 1's deal key is the letter 'q' and player 2's is the letter 'p'.
2. If a player correctly slaps the central pile they may take it and add it to their hand. Player 1's slap is the letter' f' and player 2's slap is the letter 'j' on your keyboard.
3. A correct slap is either a Jack card, two cards of the same value in a row, or two cards of the same value sandwiched by another card.
4. Once a player runs out of cards they may redeem themselves and get back in the game but only with a Jack slap!
5. Both players must abide by this end-of-game extra rule.

### line 128 0f game.js may be commented out to toggle off an additional feature that now determines that if a player makes a good slap, there is an extra punishment that the other player must deal first.  To deal a card is to lose a card (undesired).

### Number of wins persist in local storage on users's machine.
